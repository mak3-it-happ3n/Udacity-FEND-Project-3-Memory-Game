# Game Play

The game _Matching Game_ works just like a normal _Memory_ game: The goal is to
find all pairs of matching cards. Once all pairs are found, the game is finished.

## Star Rating
A star rating at the top indicates **how well you are doing**, depending on the
number of moves you use to finish the game. The Stars diminish from 3 to 2 after
10 moves and from 2 to 1 after 13 moves (selecting 2 cards to reveal counts as one move).

## Timer
A timer starts running **once the first card is revealed**.

## Reset
The reset button next to the timer allows to **reset the counter as well as the
star rating**.
